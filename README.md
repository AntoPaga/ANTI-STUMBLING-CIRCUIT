# ANTI-STUMBLING-CIRCUIT
ANTI STUMBLING CIRCUIT
The circuit is not very different from a common metronome, but unlike the musical circuit, in this case, we need to control both the beat frequency and the duty cycle of the wave. Two common integrated circuits, such as the 555 timer, were chosen for the implementation. The first 555 is responsible for managing the beat frequency, while the second controls the tone heard through the earphone. The 555 also provides enough output power at pin 3 to drive a 32-ohm earphone. The circuit runs on a standard 12V battery and, if kept at low volumes, offers considerable battery life.
